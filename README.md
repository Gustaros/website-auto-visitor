# Website Auto Visitor

A browser extension for automating daily website visits, check-ins, and collecting rewards. Website Auto Visitor lets you record your actions (clicks, text input, and more) on any site and replay them automatically. Perfect for automating daily bonuses, check-ins, and repetitive web tasks. Supports multiple sites, scenarios, and full localization.

## Key Features
- **Record and replay actions:** Easily record clicks, text input, and navigation on any website using the extension popup, then replay them with one click.
- **Scenario management:** Save, rename, describe, and organize multiple scenarios per website. Quickly switch between them.
- **Advanced section:** Export, import, or delete all scenarios in one place. The Advanced section is collapsible and fully localized.
- **Scheduling (coming soon):** Set up daily or timed automation for your scenarios (feature in roadmap).
- **Auto-run:** Optionally run all scenarios automatically on browser startup.
- **Cross-browser:** Works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
- **Full localization:** All UI elements, tooltips, and section titles are available in English, Russian, German, French, Spanish, and Chinese.
- **Privacy-focused:** All data is stored locally. The Privacy Policy link is always at the bottom of the popup.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive popup with search, drag-and-drop, and onboarding tips.


## Example Use Cases
- Automate daily check-ins and bonus collections on gaming, crypto, or loyalty sites
- Fill out repetitive forms or perform routine web tasks
- Save time on sites that require daily manual actions
- Quickly switch between different automation scenarios for different sites

## How It Works
1. Open the website you want to automate.
2. Open the Website Auto Visitor popup.
3. Click **Start Recording** and perform your actions on the site.
4. Click **Stop Recording** or use Ctrl+Shift+S to finish.
5. The scenario is saved for the current site. Optionally, add a description.
6. Select and play back any scenario from the list.
